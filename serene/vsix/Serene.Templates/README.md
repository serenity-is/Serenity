## What is the Serenity Platform

Serenity is an ASP.NET Core / TypeScript application platform designed to simplify and shorten the development of data-centric business applications with a service-based architecture.

It aims to make development easier while reducing maintenance costs by avoiding boilerplate code, reducing the time spent on repetitive tasks, and applying the best software design practices. 

Serene is a starter template to build Serenity applications.
