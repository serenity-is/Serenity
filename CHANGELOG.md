Bugfixes:
  - fix null reference exception on t4 transform
  - Skip Take With Order By clause used correct syntax for OracleDialect
## 3.1.0 (2017-10-16)

Features:
  - support CSRF (cross site request forgery) protection in Serenity pages / services. it is highly recommended to apply changes in latest Serene commit to your existing project to enable CSRF protection!
  - .net core sergen no longer has dependency to serenity.web, thus asp.net core, so it is now much slimmer and 10 times faster to load
  - improved .net core build / dotnet sergen transform time significantly (20x) if input files (.ts) didn't change by employing caching in TSTypeLister.
  - t4 transform files in .net framework version is also much faster (caching + change control), see latest commit
  - t4 transform doesn't modify files if only line endings changed, solves a problem with git due to line ending transformation (files was looking like changed after T4 transform)
  - servertypings t4 transform doesn't invoke tsc if none of files changed
  - typescript compiler is only invoked when an input file changes which improves build time significantly, see changes in Serene.csproj
  - using Microsoft.TypeScript.MsBuild package instead of Node based TSC in Serene AspNetCore (usually 2x faster)
  - less compiler is only invoked when an input file changes which improves build time significantly, see changes in Serene.csproj
  - use scriban template engine for sergen
  - it is now possible to override templates sergen uses by setting "CustomTemplates" option to a directory with .scriban templates. if there is a template with same name (e.g. Row.scriban) in that directory sergen uses that, otherwise uses default embedded one.
  - sergen provides option to generate custom files by setting CustomGenerate option in configuration file. this is a dictionary of template file => output file format ({0} class name, {1} Module, {2} class path, {3} typings path)
  - it is possible to show / editor custom settings (boolean/string) by adding them to CustomSettings dictionary in sergen configuration file. these settings are available as {{CustomSettings.SettingKey}} in scriban templates.
  - added "mvct" command to sergen that does mvc / clienttypes at once. used this option for pre build script instead of two calls to dotnet-sergen.
  - removed rowwithregion, lookup generate options etc as they are now possible with custom generate option and custom settings
  - sergen no longer generates code for Saltaralle. script project option is removed. use an older sergen version if you still generate code for saltaralle.
  - put each field on separate line for easier merge in ServerTypings generated files (for easier merge in git)
  - support quick filter persist / restore  (thanks @marcobisio, pull request #1455)
  - add FullTextContains quick search type (simple version of pull request #2200 that only support quick search with contains for performance reasons, thanks @marcobisio)

Features:
  - made it possible to use bootstrap col-md-6, col-sm-4 etc. to layout form fields. 
  - added attribute FormCssClassAttribute for applying custom sizes.
  - use HalfWidthAttribute, OneThirdWidthAttribute, QuarterWidth etc. for quick field sizing 
  - added ImplicitPermissionAttribute and related auto permission granting system which is a much better alternative to LogicOperatorPermissionService. e.g. when a user / role has Northwind:Modify permission, it should also automatically have Northwind:View and Northwind:General permissions
  - in addition to resizing canvas, also invalidate grid on resize, fixes some display issues on windows 7 pcs
  - added missing class declaration for IStringValue to .d.ts
