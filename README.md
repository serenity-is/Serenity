## What is Serenity Platform

Serenity is an ASP.NET MVC / TypeScript application platform designed to simplify and shorten development of data-centric business applications with a service based architecture.

It aims to make development easier while reducing maintenance costs by avoiding boiler-plate code, reducing the time spent on repetitive tasks and applying best software design practices.

## Quick Start

The easiest and fastest way to get your hands dirty on Serenity is by using a sample application template (Serene) from Visual Studio Gallery at https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/559ec6fc-feef-4077-b6d5-5a99408a6681

You can also install it directly from Visual Studio, by entering File -> New -> Project -> Online and searching for *SERENE*.

Please read documentation at https://volkanceylan.gitbooks.io/serenity-guide for step-by-step tutorials.

## Support / Spread the Word

You may contribute to the project by opening a pull request, adding documentation, sample source code, asking a question or suggesting an improvement etc. Just open an issue here with relevant links.

If you are using Serenity in any open source / commercial projects let me know, so i can add it to the list of references.

.NET open source community is a bit limited and is not so active, so if you help spread the word by posting in forums, starring the project here and in Visual Studio Gallery, i'll appreciate it much.
