## What is the Serenity Platform

Serenity is an ASP.NET Core / TypeScript application platform designed to simplify and shorten the development of data-centric business applications with a service-based architecture.

It aims to make development easier while reducing maintenance costs by avoiding boiler-plate code, reducing the time spent on repetitive tasks, and applying best software design practices.

## Quickstart (Serene)

> Premium customers should use the StartSharp template which they can download from the [Serenity members area](https://serenity.is/Account/Login/).

Ensure you have the necessary [requirements](https://serenity.is/docs/getting_started/README#prerequisites) installed.
```bash
# Install/Update Serene.Templates package.
> dotnet new install Serene.Templates

# Create a new Serene project.
> dotnet new serene -n MySereneApp

# Navigate into your project folder.
> cd MySereneApp/MySereneApp.Web

# Install NPM packages.
> npm i

# Build and run the project.
> dotnet run
```
That's it! âœ¨ You can visit `http://localhost:5000` (actual port may vary, check the console after `dotnet run`) to see your running [Serene](https://github.com/serenity-is/Serene) application.
