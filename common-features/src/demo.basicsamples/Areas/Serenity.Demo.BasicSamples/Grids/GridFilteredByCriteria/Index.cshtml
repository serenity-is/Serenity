        There are several ways to filter a grid in Serenity. Quick search box, quick filters
        and edit filter dialog etc. All of these filtering options are modifiable
        by end users. Even if you set an initial filter, end user might be able to clear it.

        Sometimes you may want to prefilter records that are shown in a particular page.
        ListRequest has a "Criteria" parameter to let you handle this from client
        side (this parameter is also used by edit filter dialog).

        Here we show only products that match criteria "UnitsInStock > 10 and Category != Condiments and 
        Discountinued == false". See @Html.BasicSamplesSourceFile("GridFilteredByCriteriaPage.ts") to see how.
